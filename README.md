To install: Clone `git@github.com:annamkummer/AnnaAndDavidMotivationalPosters.git`

## Wins:
  - We improved our understanding of the interactions between Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
  - We also had a lot of fun working together to build this site.

## Challenges and improvements:
  - A challenge we had was fixing an issue with the randomize function running every time we went back to the main page. We solved this by adding an event.preventDefault() function within the event listener.
  - Future plans for the application include error messages upon incorrect data input, allowing users to click each piece of the poster to update, and allowing users to drag and drop saved posters into their desired order.
